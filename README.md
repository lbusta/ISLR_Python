# An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python

This is my personal project about the book [An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/).

The book covers all the fundamental techniques of the statistical learning from
a theoretical and specially practical point of view. All the code shown in the
book is written in R language. The aim of this project is to develop all the lab exercises and
most interesting figures that appear in the book using Python as the main programming language.

The project structure is divided in one folder per each chapter, containing one Jupyter Notebook along with Python scripts in a *src* folder which serve as a source for most of the notebook content.
